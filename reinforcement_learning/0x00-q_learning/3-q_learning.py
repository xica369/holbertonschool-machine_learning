    Function that
    performs Q-learning:

    - env is the FrozenLakeEnv instance
    - Q is a numpy.ndarray containing the Q-table
    - episodes is the total number of episodes to train over
    - max_steps is the maximum number of steps per episode
    - alpha is the learning rate
    - gamma is the discount rate
    - epsilon is the initial threshold for epsilon greedy
    - min_epsilon is the minimum value that epsilon should decay to
    - epsilon_decay is the decay rate for updating epsilon between episodes

    Returns: Q, total_rewards
    - Q is the updated Q-table
    - total_rewards is a list containing the rewards per episode
